I am a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/) working on higher category theory and homotopy type theory. 

I am a co-host of the [n-Category Caf&eacute;](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) and was a founding board member of [Spectra](http://lgbtmath.org/). <img src="https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/progress-pride.webp" width = "5%"/>

I serve on the editorial boards for [Homology, Homotopy, and Applications](https://www.intlpress.com/index.php) and the [Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-pure-and-applied-algebra/editorial-board). 

There is a rapidly expanding group of PhD students at Johns Hopkins who are interested in category theory, abstract homotopy theory, and homotopy type theory. Some of their activities can be found on the webpage for the  [Johns Hopkins Category Theory Seminar](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/ct/). If you are interested in joining us, more information about graduate admissions can be found [here](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/graduate/admissions/).
