I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/) working on higher category theory and homotopy type theory. 

I frequently collaborate with [Dominic Verity](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/dominic-verity) at the Centre of Australian Category Theory. I am a host of the [n-Category Caf&eacute;](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) and founder of the [Kan Extension Seminar](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/kan).
